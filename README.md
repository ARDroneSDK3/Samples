Runnable samples
---------------

### iOS
#### [RSPilotingNewAPI](https://github.com/ARDroneSDK3/Samples/tree/master/iOS/RSPilotingNewAPI)
This example enables you to **discover** and **connect** to a RollingSpider and **send and receive commands** to pilot it and get its battery level.<br/> **It uses the new and simplified API (ARController)**

#### [BebopPilotingNewAPI](https://github.com/ARDroneSDK3/Samples/tree/master/iOS/BebopPilotingNewAPI)
This example enables you to **discover** and **connect** to a Bebop drone and **send and receive commands** to pilot it, get its battery level and display video stream.<br/> **It uses the new and simplified API (ARController)**

### Android
#### [BebopDronePilotingNewAPI](https://github.com/ARDroneSDK3/Samples/tree/master/Android/BebopDronePilotingNewAPI)
This example enables you to **discover** and **connect** to a Bebop drone, **send and receive commands** to pilot it and get its battery level and other states.<br/> **It uses the new and simplified API (ARController)**

#### [RollingSpiderPilotingNewAPI](https://github.com/ARDroneSDK3/Samples/tree/master/Android/RollingSpiderPilotingNewAPI)
This example enables you to **discover** and **connect** to a RollingSpider, **send and receive commands** to pilot it and get its battery level and other states.<br/> **It uses the new and simplified API (ARController)**

### Unix
#### [JSPilotingNewAPI](https://github.com/ARDroneSDK3/Samples/tree/master/Unix/JSPilotingNewAPI)
This example enables you to **connect** to a JumpingSumo and **send and receive commands** to pilot it and get its battery level. It also **receives the video stream**. <br/>**It uses the new and simplified API (ARController)**

#### [JumpingSumoReceiveStream](https://github.com/ARDroneSDK3/Samples/tree/master/Unix/JumpingSumoReceiveStream)
This example enables you to **connect** to a JumpingSumo and **receive the video stream**.
Two options are available : either display the stream (using ffplay) or store frames on the file system.

#### [BebopDroneReceiveStream](https://github.com/ARDroneSDK3/Samples/tree/master/Unix/BebopDroneReceiveStream)
This example enables you to **connect** to a Bebop drone and **receive the h264 video stream**.

#### [BebopDroneDecodeStream](https://github.com/ARDroneSDK3/Samples/tree/master/Unix/BebopDroneDecodeStream)
This example enables you to **connect** to a Bebop, **send commands** to pilot it, **receive the h264 video stream**, **decode it**, and display this decoded stream.
